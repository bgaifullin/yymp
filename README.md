# yymp
*yymp* is a typelist manipulation library for C++11, C++14, and the upcoming C++17 standards.

# Requirements
A C++ compiler supporting at least the C++11 standard.
Different implementations of provisions may be available with more recent standards.
In addition, some features may require the C++14 or C++17 standards to be available.

# Usage
As the *yymp* is a header-only library, simply include this library in the include path.

# Changes
*yymp* has undergone some changes recently! Quite a number actually.
  * Alias templates are far less prevalent
  * Removal of integer sequence manipulation (to better direct the focus of the library)
  * Removal of a number of some superfluous features, such as accessors, conversions, and reversal
  * Replaced complicated template rebinding with a much simpler implementation and limited usage

# Example Usage
This section is TODO, since the previous examples are no longer applicable.

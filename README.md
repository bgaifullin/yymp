# yymp
*yymp* is a type list manipulation library for C++11, C++14, and the upcoming C++17 standards.

# Requirements
A C++ compiler supporting at least the C++11 standard.
Different implementations of provisions may be available with more recent standards.
In addition, some features may require the C++14 or C++17 standards to be available.

# Changes
*yymp* has undergone some changes recently! Quite a number actually.
  * Alias templates are far less prevalent
  * Removal of integer sequence manipulation (to better direct the focus of the library)
  * Removal of a number of some superfluous features, such as accessors, conversions, and reversal
  * Replaced complicated template rebinding with a much simpler implementation and limited usage

# Example Usage
There are two ways to include the headers for type lists.
``` c++
#include <yymp/typelist_fwd.hpp>
```
This will include just the type list definition, without any other functionality.
``` c++
#include <yymp/typelist.hpp>
```
This will include the type list definition as well as the manipulation features.
The examples that follow assume that this header is included.

Type lists are types themselves. To create one, use the `yymp::typelist` class template.
``` c++
using my_types = yymp::typelist<int, char*, int, void*>;
```

We sometime need to join two or more type lists.
``` c++
using foo_types = yymp::typelist<void, void, short>;
using my_joined_types = typename yymp::join<foo_types, my_types, foo_types>::type; 
// -> void, void, short, int, char*, int, void*, void, void, short
```
This is the style chosen for this library when typelists are manipulated; the result is stored as the `type` nested class.

We can also group types in a type list by a selector, the result of which is a type list of `group` types.
``` c++
template<class T>
struct identity_selector {
    using type = T;
};

using my_groups = typename yymp::group_by<identity_selector, my_types>::type; 
// -> yymp::group<int, yymp::typelist<int, int>>, yymp::group<char*, yymp::typelist<char*>>, yymp::group<void*, yymp::typelist<void*>>
```

The result can be manipulated by other features such as `transform` and `expand` to create interesting functionality.
``` c++
using my_distinct_types = typename yymp::transform<yymp::get_group_key, my_groups>::type;
// -> int, char*, void*

using my_group_types = typename yymp::transform_into<yymp::get_group_types, my_groups>::type;
// -> yymp::typelist<int, int>, yymp::typelist<char*>, yymp::typelist<void*>

using my_sorted_types = typename yymp::expand<yymp::join, my_group_types>::type; // equivalent to typename yymp::join< T... >::type for T in my_group_types
// -> int, int, char*, void*
```

Notice that we performed a filter for duplicates when creating `my_distinct_types`. This could also have been written
``` c++
using my_distinct_types = typename yymp::filter_duplicates<my_types>::type;
```

Speaking of filters...
``` c++
#include <type_traits>
using my_ptr_types = typename yymp::filter<std::is_pointer, my_types>::type;
// -> char*, void*
```
